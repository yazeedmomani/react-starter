# ScrollToTop

## Overview

This component, as its name suggests, automatically scrolls you to top.

## Required Packages

None.

## Guide

Just add the JSX file to your project folder. Then, depending on when you want it to scroll you to top, add this line of JSX code to a component of your choice.

    <ScrollToTop dependency={YOUR_CHOICE} />

Replace YOUR_CHOICE with a variable of your choice. This variable will be used as a dependency, meaning that whenever this varaible changes, you will be scrolled back to top.
